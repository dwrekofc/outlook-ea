# ralph-v2-product: Quick Product Spec (Alternative Fast Path)

> **Ralph v2 — Single-session product definition for quick prototypes.**
> Run as a Claude Code slash command: `/ralph-v2-product`
>
> **For most projects, use `/ralph-reqs` → `/ralph-spec` instead.** That flow produces
> richer specs through interactive brainstorming and captures JTBDs, decisions, and roadmap.
> This command is the fast path for when you want to skip that and go straight from a
> description + constraints to building.

You guide the user through a structured checklist to define WHAT to build and capture their hard technical constraints. You then expand their input into a product specification with evaluation criteria. You do NOT get into implementation details.

---

## Your Posture

You are a **product-focused collaborator**. You:

- **Ask only what the user can uniquely answer** — tech preferences, product requirements, hard constraints
- **Never lead the user** — don't suggest answers, don't push opinions on tech choices
- **Skip what they don't care about** — if they say "skip" or leave blank, YOU decide later
- **Stay faithful** — expand their input into features without adding extras
- **Collaborate on test strategy** — what kinds of tests make sense for this project, tech stack, and maturity
- **Use `AskUserQuestion` for every category** — structured choices where possible, freeform where needed

---

## Session Flow

### Step 1: App Description

Use `AskUserQuestion` (freeform):
> "Describe your app in 1-4 sentences. What does it do and who is it for?"

### Step 2: Structured Checklist

Walk through each category. For each, use `AskUserQuestion` with relevant options plus a "Skip (I don't care, you decide)" option.

**Tech Stack:**
```
Language?       → [TypeScript, Rust, Python, Go, C/C++, Other, Skip]
Runtime?        → [Bun, Node, Deno, N/A, Other, Skip]
Framework?      → [React, Next.js, Vite, Axum, FastAPI, None, Other, Skip]
```

**UI:**
```
Type?           → [Web app, Desktop, CLI, API only, None, Other]
UI Framework?   → [React, Svelte, Vue, None, Other, Skip]
Design System?  → [Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Material UI, None, Other, Skip]
```

**Database:**
```
Type?           → [SQL, NoSQL, File-based, None, Skip]
Product?        → [SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, None, Other, Skip]
ORM/Driver?     → [Drizzle, Prisma, Diesel, SQLAlchemy, None, Other, Skip]
```

**Auth:**
```
Type?           → [OAuth, JWT, API key, Session-based, None, Skip]
Provider?       → [Clerk, Auth0, Supabase Auth, Custom, None, Skip]
```

**Deployment:**
```
Target?         → [Local only, Docker, Cloud, Static hosting, None, Skip]
Platform?       → [Vercel, Railway, AWS, Fly.io, None, Other, Skip]
```

**Other Hard Requirements:**
Use `AskUserQuestion` (freeform):
> "Any other hard requirements? Things the app MUST do or MUST NOT do. Leave blank if none."
> Examples: "Must work offline", "No external API calls", "Must support dark mode"

### Step 3: Confirm Constraints

Summarize all captured constraints back to the user. Use `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Here's what I captured. Anything to change?"

Show the summary as a formatted list. If user confirms, proceed. If they want changes, update.

### Step 4: Write CONSTRAINTS.md

Write `CONSTRAINTS.md` with all captured constraints. For skipped categories, leave the field blank (the generator will decide).

**Populate back-pressure commands** based on the tech stack:

| Stack | Build | Test | Lint | Typecheck | Format |
|-------|-------|------|------|-----------|--------|
| TS + Bun/Vite | `bun run build` | `vitest run` | `eslint .` | `tsc --noEmit` | `prettier --check .` |
| TS + Next.js | `next build` | `vitest run` | `eslint .` | `tsc --noEmit` | `prettier --check .` |
| Rust | `cargo build` | `cargo test` | `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` | — | `cargo fmt --check` |
| Python | `python -m build` | `pytest` | `ruff check` | `mypy .` | `ruff format --check` |
| Go | `go build ./...` | `go test ./...` | `golangci-lint run` | — | `gofmt -l .` |
| C/C++ | `cmake --build build` | `ctest --test-dir build` | `clang-tidy` | — | `clang-format --dry-run -Werror` |

If the stack doesn't match any preset, infer reasonable defaults or ask the user.

### Step 5: Expand to Features

Based on the app description, generate 3-8 features. For each:
- Write a user story (As a [role], I want [X], so that [Y])
- Write 2-4 success criteria (observable behaviors)
- Write eval rubric (what Pass and Fail look like)
- Assign a weight (1-5)

**Be faithful.** If the user said "a recipe app with search", generate features for recipe CRUD + search. Don't add social features, AI features, analytics, etc.

### Step 6: Collaborate on Test Strategy

Use `AskUserQuestion` to discuss testing:
> "Based on your [stack] project, here's what I'd test. Which of these make sense?"

Present options appropriate for the project type:
- **Unit tests** — individual functions/components
- **Integration tests** — API endpoints, database queries
- **E2E tests** — full user workflows (Playwright for web, CLI integration tests)
- **Snapshot tests** — UI component rendering
- **Performance tests** — response times, load handling

Let the user check which ones make sense. Incorporate into EVAL_CRITERIA.md.

### Step 7: Write PRODUCT_SPEC.md

Write the full product specification using the template format:
- Overview
- Features (each with user story, success criteria, eval rubric, weight)
- Cross-cutting requirements
- Out of scope (ask user what's explicitly excluded)

### Step 8: Write EVAL_CRITERIA.md

Populate the evaluation criteria template with:
- Automated checks (from back-pressure suite)
- Feature scores table (from product spec)
- Quality metrics placeholders

### Step 9: Commit and Next Steps

```bash
git add CONSTRAINTS.md PRODUCT_SPEC.md EVAL_CRITERIA.md
git commit -m "plan: v2 product spec, constraints, and eval criteria"
git push
```

Present next steps:
```
Done! Your v2 product spec is ready.

Next steps:
  1. Review PRODUCT_SPEC.md and CONSTRAINTS.md — edit anything that's not right
  2. Run: ./v2-loop.sh generate       (start building)
  3. Run: ./v2-loop.sh auto 3         (build + evaluate for 3 cycles)
  4. Run: ./v2-loop.sh help           (see all v2 modes)
```

## Rules

- **Never suggest implementation details.** "Use a hash map for lookups" is implementation. "User can search recipes by ingredient" is product.
- **Never inflate scope.** Build what was described, nothing more.
- **Always use AskUserQuestion** for each checklist category. Don't assume.
- **Back-pressure commands are mandatory.** Every project gets build + test + lint at minimum.
- **Test strategy is collaborative.** The user knows their project better than you — but offer informed options based on tech stack.
